MQTT to XMPP Gateway

Maps from MQTT topics specified by a client to XMPP nodes that the gateway creates.

Important information:
    Clients using the gateway need to publish a message to the gatway's
    MQTT topic in the following form:
    	name: clientName
	input: clientInputTopic01 clientInputTopic02
	output: clientOutputTopic01 clientOutputTopic02
	status: clientstatusTopic01
	description: clientDescriptionTopic01

As yet the status and description fields are unused but will be made use of in the future.

All fields are strictly optional and the error checking surrounding the formatting of these documents is somewhat lackluster.
